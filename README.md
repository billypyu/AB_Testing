*Pricing Differences*

Since the p-value is much smaller than 0.05 threshold, so we reject H0, and accept HA, that is, test group's average revenue is significantly higher than control group's average revenue.
but due to OS distribution aren't the same between test/control groups, price isn't the only difference between test/control groups, so we cannot contribute the increase in average revenue to price.
the experiment design fails, I cannot answer decide whether we can sell software to all users in 59 dollars. I suggest
	1.	find the reason why linux users have different representation ratio than other OS.
	2.	then run the experiment again, make sure price is the only difference between test and control group
	3.	then run t-test again, to see whether the average revenue is significantly improved.
	4.	then I can draw the conclusion.


*Actionable Insights*

	•	friend_referral, Apple user (MAC or iOS), low price are three great positive factors which improve the conversion rate
	•	if we want to increase the price, which impacts negatively on conversion rate, we must compensate on the other two factors
	◦	lauch special marketing program targeted to Apple users (MAC or iOS users)
	◦	run some program which rewards user which can invite his/her friend to use our software
	•	Linux users don't like our software as much as users on other OS. Development team should find out the reason. For example, is there any incompatibility issue on Linux?
